My Notes
---------------
Project: Tip calculator
In thi project we started by getting the code template from the developer android page
and then we modified to accomplish the functionality of the tip calculator.
The project is divided in two sections, one is the basic configuration of the app
where the tip amount is hardcoded, and the used has not control over it.
The second part is adding the options for the user to add calculate a desired amount
for the tip, and also to have the option to round up the tip amount.
